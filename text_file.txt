Points to Remember

 Lists the indexes are integers whereas in dictionary we can create our indices

 Dictionaries are a mapping data type  indexed by keys

 The index is called key and the element which is indexed with the key is value Therefore it is
often called as keyvalue pair

 The keys are mapped with the values and the values can be accessed using the keys

 Dictionaries are mutable However a dictionaries keys must be immutable

 Duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated

 Indexing and Slicing concepts are not applicable we will get an Error
